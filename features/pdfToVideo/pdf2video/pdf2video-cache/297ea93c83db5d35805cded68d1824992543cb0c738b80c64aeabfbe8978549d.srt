00:00:00,206 --> 00:00:06,000
Full Functional Dependency - In a given relation R, X and Y are attributes. Attribute Y

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,633
is fully functionally dependent on attribute X only if it is not functionally dependent

3
00:00:10,633 --> 00:00:13,419
on sub-set of X where X is composite in nature.

00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:19,463
Partial Functional Dependency â€“The FD (functional dependency) A->B happens to be

5
00:00:19,463 --> 00:00:24,301
a partial dependency if B is functionally dependent on A, and also B can be determined

6
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:26,234
by any other proper subset of A.
