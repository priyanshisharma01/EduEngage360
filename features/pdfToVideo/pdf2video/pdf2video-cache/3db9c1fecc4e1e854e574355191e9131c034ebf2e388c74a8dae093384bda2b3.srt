Normalization

2
00:00:01,027 --> 00:00:06,969
Normalization is a systematic approach of decomposing tables to eliminate data redundancy and undesirable

3
00:00:06,969 --> 00:00:10,607
characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion anomalies.

4
00:00:10,607 --> 00:00:13,597
▪ These would include two properties

5
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:18,845
o Lossless join property - which guarantees that the generation of spurious tuples will not occur.

6
00:00:18,845 --> 00:00:24,552
o Dependency preservation property - This ensures that each functional dependency is represented in

7
00:00:24,552 --> 00:00:27,596
some individual relation resulting after decomposition.

8
00:00:27,596 --> 00:00:34,449
▪ Prime attribute - An attribute of relation schema R is called a prime attribute of R if it is a member

9
00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:35,888
of some candidate key of R.

10
00:00:35,888 --> 00:00:43,141
▪ Non-prime attribute - An attribute is called nonprime if it is not a prime attribute—that is, if it is

11
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:44,890
not a member of any candidate key.
