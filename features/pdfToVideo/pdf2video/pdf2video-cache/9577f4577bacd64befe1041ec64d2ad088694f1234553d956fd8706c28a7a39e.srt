Attribute Closure

2
00:00:01,129 --> 00:00:05,377
The set of all those attributes which can be functionally determined from an attribute set is

3
00:00:05,377 --> 00:00:07,415
called as closure of that attribute set.

4
00:00:07,415 --> 00:00:10,230
Steps to find closure of an attribute set:

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,502
1. Add the attributes contained in the attribute set for which closure is being calculated

6
00:00:15,502 --> 00:00:16,463
to the result set.

7
00:00:16,463 --> 00:00:21,562
2. Recursively add the attributes to the result set which can be functionally determined

8
00:00:21,562 --> 00:00:24,390
from the attributes already contained in the result set.

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:32,606
Example: Consider a relation R(A,B,C,D,E,F,G) with the functional dependencies
