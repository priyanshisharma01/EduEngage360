Trivial Dependency -A Functional Dependency X ->Y is said to be trivial functional

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,215
dependency if y is a subset of X( Y ⊆X). In other words if R.H.S of some FD is the subset

00:00:11,215 --> 00:00:14,666
of L.H.S of FD is called Trivial Functional Dependency.

generates a closure of functional dependencies. Refer Class notes.
